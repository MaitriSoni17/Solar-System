        Uranus is the third largest planet, a featureless world which orbits on its side. It has 27 moons which are mostly named after characters in Shakespeare's plays. Uranus was the first planet to be discovered as all 
        of the other closer planets have been observed from Earth for thousands of years. It was discovered in 1781 by English astronomer, William Herschel. Uranus takes 84 years to orbit the Sun.
