        Venus is the second closest planet to the Sun and the sixth largest of all of the Solar System's planets. It is the brightest object in the sky after the Sun and the Moon, appearing to be a beautiful and tranquil 
        world from a distance. Some have even believed it to be Earth's twin. But get up close if you dare, and you'll discover that Venus has poisonous clouds of sulphuric acid and carbon dioxide, a surface of volcanic 
        ruins, and suffocating temperatures of 480 °C (896 °F). All day, every day. Interestingly though, Venus's day is longer than its year, with the planet taking 243 days to turn once on its axis, but 224 days to 
        complete an orbit of the Sun. Like Mercury, Venus is also a bit of a loner and has no moons orbiting it.
