        The Moon or Luna is Earth’s only satellite. It is the only natural satellite that formed 4.6 billion years ago from debris generated through the collision of the planets Earth and Mars. The Moon is approximately 
        238000 miles away and revolves around the Earth.The Moon is the only celestial object closet to the Moon and revolves in synchronous rotation with Earth. However, reports state that there are no air or atmosphere on 
        the Moon; thus, no signs for any lifeforms.The first uncrewed mission to the Moon took place in the year 1959 conducted by the Soviet Lunar Program. The first with crewed landing on the Moon being Apollo mission 11 
        took place in the year 1969. The Moon is Earth’s only natural satellite and is quarter the size of the Earth.The Moon’s gravity is around 1/6th of the Earth’s gravity.The gravitational field on the Moon is measured 
        by the radio signals known as “Doppler shift”.The Moon is the only celestial body that is at the distance of 384400 km and is closest to the Earth.Moon is claimed to around approximately 4.53 billion old.Moon cannot 
        endure water and causes photodissociation when exposed to solar radiation.The first mission was called the Apollo 11 in 1969 with Neil Armstrong as the first human to land on the Moon.The Moon takes about 27 days, 
        7 hours, 43 minutes, 11.6 seconds to complete one rotation around the Earth.In the entire Solar system, the Moon is the fifth largest satellite.The temperature on the Moon fluctuates between +200 to -200 degree 
        Celsius.
