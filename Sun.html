        First up is the Sun. This is a star, a large ball of gas situated slap bang in the middle of the Solar System. The Sun produces heat and light and is the only natural source of light in the Solar System. Without it, 
        we'd all be pretty much scuppered. The Sun is by far the largest object in the Solar System, being 109 times wider than Earth. About 98% of the Solar System's total mass is contained within the Sun. It generates its 
        power by converting hydrogen into helium in a process called nuclear fusion.<strong>Temperatures at the surface of the Sun reach a balmy 5,500 °C (9,900 °F), although there are darker and cooler patches on the Sun 
        called sunspots where temperatures are anywhere between 2,700 °C to 4,200 °C (4,900 °F to 7,600 °F).</strong> Every now and again, the Sun spews out Solar Flares, rapidly sending out bursts of energy across the Solar 
        System. On Earth, Solar Flares cause auroras near the North and South Poles, which are beautiful light displays known as the Northern Lights and the Southern Lights.<strong>The Sun is a faily average yellow dwarf 
        star, and should remain as one for about 9 billion years. Over 4 billion of those years have already passed, so it is nearly half way through its main life.</strong> Eventually, as its energy supplies begin to run 
        out, it will get even larger and even hotter and become a red giant. By then, it is likely that it will become large enough to absorb some of the planets closest to it. That'll be my cue for introducing the planets....
