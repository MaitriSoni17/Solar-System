        Mars is the final of the four Inner Planets and the second smallest of all planets. It is about a quarter of the size of Earth and is a popular destination for unmanned space missions from Earth. This is because, 
        one, it isn't quite as inhospitable as Venus and two, it's possible that life could survive on it, either now or sometime in its dark and distant past. We know that water did once flow freely on Mars, and that 
        volcanoes once erupted happily there too. That's not saying that Mars is an ideal holiday destination. Its average surface temperature is -63 °C (-81 °F), and its atmosphere is mostly Carbon Dioxide, which most 
        Earth-based lifeforms don't particularly like to breathe in. Despite this, Mars is undoubtedly next in the list of places that Man (or Woman) will visit in the Solar System. When this will happen, nobody knows, 
        but it will happen one day. Mars has a red surface and pink skies, and can easily be observed from Earth. Mars takes 687 to complete an orbit of the Sun, and has two small moons orbiting it. These moons are named 
        Phobos and Deimos.
