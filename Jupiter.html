        Jupiter is the first of the Outer Planets and is the largest planet in the Solar System. It is mostly made up of hydrogen and helium gas, but contains a load of other gasses too. When observing Jupiter, we can only 
        really see its upper atmosphere which is divided into bands which are different temperatures, contain different chemicals and have winds that go in opposite directions to the ones next to them. There is one 
        particular area of Jupiter where a storm has been raging for hundreds of years. This is the Great Red Spot which is twice as large as Earth. Nobody really knows why it is red! Jupiter has at least 79 moons orbiting 
        it, including the Solar System's largest moon (Ganymede), the most volcanic moon (Io) and one that may be entirely covered with water under a surface of ice (Europa). Jupiter takes 9 hours and 55 minutes to turn on 
        its axis, meaning that its day is the shortest of all planets, but takes almost 12 years (11.8 years) to get around the Sun.
