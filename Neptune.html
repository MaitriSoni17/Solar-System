         Neptune is the most distant of the eight planets in the Solar System. It was discovered in 1846 by German astonomer, Johann Gottfried Galle. Neptune is a deep blue colour, with darker patches representing 
         stormy areas that come and go over time. Neptune is thought to be the windiest planet in the Solar System. Neptune has 14 known moons and takes 165 years to get around the Sun, meaning that since it was 
         discovered it has only completed one journey around the Sun.
