        Saturn is the second largest planet in the Solar System. It is similar in make-up to Jupiter, but isn't quite as stormy. What makes Saturn stand out though are its rather splendid rings. These rings are layers of 
        rock and ice that orbit the planet. Like Jupiter, Saturn also has lots of moons (82 at the last count), including Titan which has a thick atmosphere, and Enceladus which erupts plumes of water particles, creating 
        one of Saturn's rings and suggesting that there is lots of water on it. Saturn takes 29 years to orbit the Sun.
